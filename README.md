# Personal Website

Source code for [danvolchek.com](https://danvolchek.com).

Holds details about me and my projects.

The update script re-generates the static site content to make keeping the site up to date easy.
It takes:
 - a list of projects and renders the projects overview + sections for each project
 - a list of Stardew Valley mods and renders a list of each mod, with current download statistics by querying NexusMods

The update script should be run with a working directory of the scripts folder.
